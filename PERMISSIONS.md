# Permissions

**By granting Enceladus these permissions,
you are implicitly giving the API the ability and authority to perform these actions on your behalf.
This includes the ability for a moderator of the subreddit you have posted in to edit the post freely.**

When authenticating, you will be asked to allow Enceladus to:

- Edit and delete my comments and submissions.
- Submit links and comments from my account.
- Access my reddit username and signup date.
- Approve, remove, mark nsfw, and distinguish content in subreddits I moderate.
- Maintain this access indefinitely (or until manually revoked).

Enceladus will also have access to your preferences,
which will be used to fetch your preferred language.
Your client of choice may use this to change the UI appropriately.

What does Enceladus need these permissions for?
Let's go through them one by one.

> Edit and delete my comments and submissions.

After we've created a thread, we need to be able to edit it to post updates.

> Submit links and comments from my account.

We need to be able to create the thread!
What good would this be without that ability?

> Access my reddit username and signup date.

Technically not necessary, but it's nice to greet you!

> Approve, remove, mark nsfw, and distinguish content in subreddits I moderate.

This will be used for the designated moderators,
allowing them to approve threads that are created,
as well as sticky them if they'd like.

> Maintain this access indefinitely (or until manually revoked).

You wouldn't want me to ask you to log in every hour now, would you?
